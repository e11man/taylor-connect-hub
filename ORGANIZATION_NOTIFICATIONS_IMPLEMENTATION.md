# Organization Email Notifications Implementation Summary

## Overview
The email notification functionality for organizations has been fully enabled on the dashboard. Organizations can now manage their email notification preferences just like regular users.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Extension
- **File**: `/workspace/supabase/migrations/20250815000005_add_organization_notification_preferences.sql`
- Extended the `notification_preferences` table with organization-specific columns:
  - `volunteer_signups` - Get notified when volunteers sign up for events
  - `volunteer_cancellations` - Get notified when volunteers cancel signups
  - `weekly_summary` - Receive weekly activity reports
  - `system_updates` - Receive platform announcements
- Updated database functions to handle the new fields

### 2. New React Component
- **File**: `/workspace/src/components/settings/OrganizationNotificationPreferences.tsx`
- Created a dedicated component for organization notification settings
- Features:
  - Email frequency selection (immediate/daily/weekly/never)
  - Toggle switches for each notification type
  - Professional UI with icons and descriptions
  - Auto-save functionality with success/error feedback

### 3. Organization Dashboard Update
- **File**: `/workspace/src/pages/OrganizationDashboard.tsx`
- Replaced the "Coming Soon" placeholder with the functional notification preferences component
- The notification settings are now fully accessible from the organization dashboard

### 4. Type Definitions Update
- **File**: `/workspace/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to include the new notification preference fields
- Ensures type safety across the application

### 5. Service Updates
- Updated notification service interfaces to include organization-specific preferences
- Documented implementation requirements for backend email services

## How It Works

1. **Organizations access their dashboard** and see the Email Notifications section
2. **They can configure**:
   - How often to receive emails (immediate, daily digest, weekly summary, or never)
   - Which types of notifications to receive (chat, events, volunteer signups, etc.)
3. **Settings are saved** to the same `notification_preferences` table used by regular users
4. **The backend services** will check these preferences before sending any emails

## Next Steps

The UI is fully functional, but the backend email services need to be implemented for:
1. Volunteer signup notifications
2. Volunteer cancellation notifications  
3. Weekly summary reports
4. System update announcements

See `/workspace/email-service/organization_notifications_todo.md` for detailed implementation requirements.

## Testing the Implementation

To test the notification preferences:
1. Log in as an organization
2. Navigate to the Organization Dashboard
3. Scroll to the Email Notifications section
4. Adjust preferences and click "Save Preferences"
5. Verify the success message appears

The preferences are now stored in the database and will be respected once the corresponding email services are implemented.
