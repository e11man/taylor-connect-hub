# Organization Profile Edit Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented an "Edit Organization Profile" feature that allows logged-in organization users to update their profile information directly from their dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. OrganizationProfileModal Component
- **Location**: `src/components/modals/OrganizationProfileModal.tsx`
- **Form Fields**:
  - Organization Name* (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Contact Email* (required)
  - Phone Number (optional, with validation)
  - Website (optional, with URL validation)

### 2. Form Validation
- **Required Field Validation**: Organization name and contact email
- **Phone Number Validation**: Supports various phone number formats
- **Website URL Validation**: Validates proper URL format (with or without protocol)
- **Real-time Error Display**: Shows validation errors as user types
- **Loading States**: Prevents multiple submissions during save

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- **Edit Profile Button**: Added to Organization Information card header
- **Modal Integration**: Opens when "Edit Profile" button is clicked
- **Live Updates**: Organization information updates immediately after successful save
- **Success/Error Toasts**: User feedback for all operations

### 4. Security Implementation
- **RLS Enforcement**: Uses existing Supabase RLS policy `"Organizations can update their own profile"`
- **User Scoping**: Updates are scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Protected Fields**: Prevents editing of `status`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`, `user_id`
- **Input Sanitization**: Trims whitespace and handles null values properly

## Database Schema Compatibility
The implementation works with the existing `organizations` table structure:
```sql
organizations:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to auth.users)
- name: TEXT (required)
- description: TEXT (optional)
- contact_email: TEXT (required)
- phone: TEXT (optional)
- website: TEXT (optional)
- status: TEXT (managed by admin)
- approved_by: UUID (managed by admin)
- approved_at: TIMESTAMP (managed by admin)
```

## RLS Policy Verification
The feature relies on the existing RLS policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Organizations can update their own profile" 
ON public.organizations 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## UI/UX Design
- **Consistent Styling**: Uses project's color variables [[memory:5027023]]
- **Responsive Design**: Modal works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels, error messages, and keyboard navigation
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation

## Usage Instructions
1. Organization user logs into their dashboard
2. Clicks "Edit Profile" button in Organization Information section
3. Modal opens with current data pre-filled
4. User edits desired fields
5. Clicks "Update Profile" to save changes
6. Success toast appears and dashboard updates with new information
